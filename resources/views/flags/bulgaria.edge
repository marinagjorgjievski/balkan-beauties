      <b>Origination:</b> After Russia helped Bulgaria gain independence from the Ottoman Empire at the end of the Russo-Turkish War, Bulgaria adopted the Russian Flag but changed the Russian blue for green. Over the years the flag has been modified in different ways. Sometimes the countryâ€™s emblem has been placed across the white and green stripes on the left. However, the simplified version was readopted in 1990.
