      <b>Origination:</b> After Russia helped Bulgaria gain independence from the Ottoman Empire at the end of the Russo-Turkish War, Bulgaria adopted the Russian Flag but changed the Russian blue for green. Over the years the flag has been modified in different ways. Sometimes the countryâ€™s emblem has been placed across the white and green stripes on the left. However, the simplified version was readopted in 1990.<br>
      <b>Officially Adopted:</b> November 27, 1990 (current version)<br>
      <b>Flag Day:</b> Not Celebrated
