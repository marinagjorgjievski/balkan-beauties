      <b>Origination:</b> The Ottoman Empire allowed the regions of Walachia and Moldova to have their own flags. The current tricolour was adopted at the naval version of this Walachian flag. Different iterations were used throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but the constant was the colors of blue, yellow, and red.

      - During the communist era, communist emblems were added to the flag. These were stripped after the overthrow of the communist government in 1989.
