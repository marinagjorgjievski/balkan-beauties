      <b>Origination:</b> Red and gold were traditionally used on Macedonian flags, but throughout the Yugoslav era they typically had a star featured. In 1992 Macedonia created a flag with a starburst pattern based on iconography from Alexander the Great. This was a symbol of the ancient Macedonian dynasty.
    </p>
    <p>
      - That pattern is called the “Star of Verghina.” Greeks believe it is a symbol of ancient Greece (since they do not believe that Macedonia or North Macedonia has a right to claim a share of this heritage). Many Greeks did not want North Macedonia using this symbol on their flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      - Facing political and economic pressure from Greece, North Macedonia modified the flag, changing the starburst to a sunburst in 1995.
